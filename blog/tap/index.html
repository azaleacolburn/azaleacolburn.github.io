    <div class="post-content">
        <p>i have seen the best minds of my generation cowering in cafes,<br />
sipping cold brew, frantically breathing, while they still can.<br />
those ecstatic typists, jazzed, broken, endangered, and unaware<br />
who trade ginger and sell roots while urban structures still stand<br />
buying focus and forgetfulness,<br />
abstract freedom found in screens, owned by corpses of collectives and corporations</p>
<p>whose plugged in minds burst and bubble with memory structures and pointers to a void,<br />
laying bricks for the great mechanical edifice.<br />
who type faster now, crying in a quiet, numb, neutered sort of way<br />
harmonizing with the other strung up souls,<br />
they are consumed by art, by its promises and doubts</p>
<p>who quench their fears with homegrown needles, hoping to hit arteries.<br />
who revel in mechanical sanctity, divested of their own.<br />
who forget secrets each day, re-meeting with each blackened sip.<br />
who cling to shreds of liberalism, once discarded for black-red wet dreams</p>
<p>who crave that queer, blessed unrest<br />
that humming, buzzing air that keeps them marching<br />
and makes them more alive than the others.</p>
<p>whose paranoid fits leave them backwards on chairs, facing broken cameras and torn-up curtains.<br />
who worship under the blinding, burning lights.<br />
who chew on bitter chalk, dry up, cease skinning thoughts, voice ripping fantasies.<br />
who push it down their throats, trying to relish in the salt.</p>
<p>whose agony forced them through splintering wooden doors, into the cafe lights.<br />
who lust, feel dead but do it anyway, smoldering in chiaroscuro.<br />
who see one another by curse-marks on foreheads, hands, and necks.</p>
<p>who yearn for her unclean kosher body, born broken, piercing, demonettes, and can't bear it.<br />
who find themselves as failed men, deluded and reshaped.<br />
who lean closer, pretending not to weaken at the sight of her typing hands<br />
or crumble at the sight of its eyespots and tattooed freckles.<br />
who whisper ballads, two-part soliloquies of ecstasy through hours lived and slept.</p>
<p>who walk onto grass, away from the light<br />
finding the deepest darkness between buildings<br />
fingering on park benches and in alleyways<br />
shrieking and moaning, pierced by silver and peachwood<br />
squeezing chitin and porcelain, rend the flesh from their skin.</p>
<p>who twirl and pretend, gaze longingly, skating down cobbled streets<br />
to find themselves at train stops, with dreams of wildflowers and rusted boats.</p>

i have seen the best minds of my generation cowering in cafes,  
sipping down coffee, frantically breathing, while they still can.  
ecstatic typists, jazzed and broken, endangered and unaware  
who trade ginger and sell roots while urban structures still stand  
who buy focus and forgetfulness,  
abstract freedom found in screens, owned by corpses of collectives and corporations  

whose plugged in minds burst and bubble with memory structures and pointers to a void,  
laying bricks for the great mechanical edifice  
who type faster now, crying in a quiet, numb, neutered sort of way  
harmonizing with the other strung up souls,  
they are consumed by art, by its promises and doubts  

who quench their fears with homegrown needles, hoping to hit arteries  
who revel in mechanical sanctity, divested of their own  
who forget secrets each day, re-meeting with each blackened sip  
who cling to shreds of liberalism, once discarded for black-red wet dreams  

who crave that queer, blessed unrest  
that humming, buzzing air that keeps them marching  
and makes them more alive than the others  

whose paranoid fits leave them backwards on chairs, facing broken cameras and curtains  
who worship under the blinding, burning lights  
who chew on bitter chalk, dry up, cease skinning thoughts, voice ripping fantasies  
who push it down their throats, trying to relish in the salt  

whose agony forced them out through splintering wooden doors, into the cafe lights  
who lust, feel dead but do it anyway  
who see one another through curse-marks on foreheads, hands, and necks  

who yearn for her unclean kosher body, born broken, piercing, demonettes, and can't bear it  
who find themselves as failed men, deluded and reshaped  
who lean closer, pretending not to weaken at the sight of her typing hands  
or crumble at the sight of its eyespots and tattooed freckles  
who whisper ballads, two-part soliloquies of ecstasy through hours lived and slept  

who walk onto grass, away from the light  
finding the deepest darkness between buildings  
fingering on park benches and in alleyways  
shrieking and moaning, pierced by silver and peachwood  
squeezing chitin and porcelain, rend the flesh from their skin  

who twirl and pretend, gaze longingly, skating down cobbled streets  
to find themselves at train stops, with dreams of wildflowers and rusted boats

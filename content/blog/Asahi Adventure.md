Hi everyone, today I'd like to go over my journey using NixOS with Asahi Linux on my 2020 M1 MacBook Air. This post won't be a tutorial, rather a reflection on how it's gone; if you're looking for a tutorial, [this article by Sef](https://yusef.napora.org/blog/nixos-asahi/) was extremely helpful when I got started. To get NixOS working on the Asahi kernel, I used the repo [NixOS Apple Silicon](https://github.com/tpwrules/nixos-apple-silicon), which had a lovely tutorial for installation as well.

I've been daily driving NixOS on my apple silicon machine for since December of 2024, so about 6 months now, and it's been wonderful. All the drivers I need to use on a daily basic work perfectly. Asa

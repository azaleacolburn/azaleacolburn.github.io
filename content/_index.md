# Azalea Colburn

Welcome to my HyperText page on the World Wide Web.

## About Me

I'm a <span style='color: #5BCEFA;'>tr</span><span style='color: #F5A9B8;'>a</span><span style='color: #FFFFFF;'>ns</span><span style='color: #F5A9B8;'>f</span><span style='color: #5BCEFA;'>em</span> software engineer at [Autodesk](https://autodesk.com) based in Portland Oregon.
I'm also a vegetarian NixOs user.

For work, I mostly doing work on code simulation libraries, but I'm particularly interested in compilers and languages, both computer and human. As a <span style='color: #5BCEFA;'>tr</span><span style='color: #F5A9B8;'>a</span><span style='color: #FFFFFF;'>ns</span><span style='color: #F5A9B8;'>f</span><span style='color: #5BCEFA;'>em</span>, my language of choice is of course [Rust](https://rust-lang.org).

Some of my favorite media:

- Doctor Who, a long-running British Sci-Fi show about the titular Doctor Who (no, it's not "The Doctor"; real fans get it)
- [Modem Prometheus](https://modemprometheus.com), an urban fantasy podcast by [namtao](https://namtao.com)

Beyond my laptop screen, I enjoy biking, urban environments, and tea.

## Blog

I'm planning to write a blog, some some topics on my mind:

- cafes and biking trails around Portland
- interesting programming things
  - project explainations and ideas
  - suggestions for the Rust programming language
  - tools/technologies which I either care about or find interesting
- English language writing reform and/or conlang development
- urban light rail
- Hyperpop album Review
- poetry
